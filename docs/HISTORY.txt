Changelog
=========

0.1 - Unreleased
----------------

* Added a script "make.py" to automatically modify jQueryUI where
  needed.  This modifies paths to add the "++resource++" stanza, and
  modifies JavaScripts to use "jQuery" instead of "$", which is
  necessary for it to work with Plone.

* Got rid of profile.  When you include parts of jQueryUI, you must
  now do so explicitly, instead of simply turning on parts.
