jQueryUI integration for Plone.

The difference to other jQueryUI integration packages is, that this one keeps
the original directory layout of the jQueryUI source. It just registers a
resource directory, where all jQueryUI related files reside in. This makes it
easy to update the package to new jQueryUI versions.
